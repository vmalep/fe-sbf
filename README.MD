# Voil√†Book

This proyect started in the framework of a bootcamp checkpoint in order to develop a fullstack application in 2 days.

The objective of this application is to allow parents to exchange second hand school books easily.

It provides the list of requested books for each course and parents can create books they own, mark them as available with a price, in order for others to request them.

The application is still in early stage and partially implemented.

This frontend is developped with Refine (http://refine.dev) and the backed, developped with Strapi (http://strapi.io) is deployed on Heroku.

The backend repo is available here: https://github.com/vmalep/be-sbf
